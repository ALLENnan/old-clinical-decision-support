It is important to maintain therapeutic serum and tissue levels throughout the operation. Intraoperative re-dosing may be needed for long operations. However, administration of antibiotics for more than a few hours after the incision is closed offers no additional benefit to the surgical patient. Prolonged administration does increase the risk of Clostridium difficile infection and the development of antimicrobial resistant pathogens.</pre></div>

                  <div style="width:660px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:auto"><pre>The measurement period is one calendar year but the reporting period is 3 months as a calendar quarter; Q1 = Jan &#8211; Mar, Q2 = Apr &#8211; Jun, Q3 = Jul &#8211; Sep, Q4 is Oct &#8211; Dec. 

Patients for whom there are missing or inaccurate data (e.g., arrival time, medication administration, etc.) are considered to have failed the measure; the total number of patients with missing or erroneous (e.g., a time of 03:69 or a date of 10/26/2035) data (i.e., measure failures) must be reported with the results of the measure. 

General guidance: 

The original measure excludes patients who have had a laparoscopic procedure unless the laparoscopic incision has been extended during the procedure. ICD-10 allows definition of such extension with procedure codes; ICD-9 does not. For those using ICD-9 any laparoscopic procedure that extends the incision should be included. In this measure the code lists that describe types of surgical procedures remain only in ICD-9 or ICD-10 because the concepts that apply are limited to a very specific subset of all surgical procedures. 

Numerator element guidance: 

For calculation of antibiotic duration post-operatively, duration is a derived element calculated from the number of doses and frequency of doses administered post operatively. 

Note also, that all numerators numbered using "x.1" (e.g., 1.1, 2.1, etc.) are to be used for calculating successful performance for the measure.  Numerators numbered using "x.2" (e.g ., 1.2, 2.2, 3.2, etc.) are to be used for reporting only and indicate the number excluded due to valid reasons for continuing antibiotics longer than the 24 hours expected.  All instances that are described in Numerators "x.2" are also represented in exclusions. The Numerators "x.1" are intended to capture the number of procedures excluded for the purposes identified and are not to be included in the final summary calculation. 

Exclusion element guidance: 

The exclusion for patients who are clinical trial participants is limited to patients participating in a clinical trial for the same conditions as covered by the measure. Other clinical trials are not valid reasons for exclusions. 

Additional reasons for exclusion that represent "medical reasons" for continuation of antibiotics for longer than 24 hours (or 48 hours for CABG or Other cardiac surgery) include erythromycin for gastric motility disorder, or antibiotics for hepatic encephalopathy, antibiotics for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia with a diagnosis of AIDS, current malignancy of the lower extremity involving the same extremity that had joint revision surgery, documentation that a culture was taken of the operative site prior to the administration of the prophylactic antibiotic during joint revision surgery. </pre></div>

      <div>
         Calculation is generic to all measures:
         
         <ul>
            <li>Calculate the final denominator by adding all that meet denominator criteria.</li>
            <li>Subtract from the final denominator all that do not meet numerator criteria yet also meet exclusion criteria.  Note some measures
               do not have exclusion criteria.
            </li>
            <li>The performance calculation is based on the "Measure scoring" from header information above:
               					        	
               <ul>
                  <li>For "Proportion" measures, the calculation is the number meeting numerator criteria divided by the final denominator.</li>
                  <li>For "Ratio" and "Continuous Variable" measures, follow the calculation instructions in the Data Aggregation header information
                     above, if present.
                  </li>
               </ul>
               
            </li>
            <li>For measures with multiple denominators, repeat this process for each denominator and report each result separately.</li>
            <li>For measures with multiple patient populations, repeat this process for each patient population and report each result separately.</li>
            <li>For measures with multiple numerators, calculate each numerator separately within each population using the paired exclusion.</li>
         </ul>
