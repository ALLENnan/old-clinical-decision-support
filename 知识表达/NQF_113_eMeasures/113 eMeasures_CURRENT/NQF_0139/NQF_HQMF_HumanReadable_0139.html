Bloodstream infections are usually serious infections typically causing a prolongation of hospital stay and increased cost and risk of mortality.

Report BSIs that are central line-associated (i.e., a central line or umbilical catheter was in place at the time of, or within 48 hours before, onset of the event.
NOTE: There is no minimum period of time that the central line must be in place in order for the BSI to be considered central line-associated.

Location of attribution: The location where the patient was assigned on the date of the BSI event, which is further defines as the date when the first clinical evidence appeared or the date the specimen used to meet the BSI criteria was collected, whichever came first.

Central line: An intravascular catheter that terminates at or close to the heart or in one of the great vessels which is used for infusion, withdrawal of blood, or hemodynamic monitoring. The following are considered great vessels for the purpose of reporting central-line BSI and counting central-line days in the NHSN system: Aorta, pulmonary artery, superior vena cava, inferior vena cava, brachiocephalic veins, internal jugular veins, subclavian veins, external iliac veins, common iliac veins, common femoral veins, and in neonates, the umbilical artery/vein.
NOTE: 
&#8226;Neither the insertion site nor the type of device may be used to determine if a line qualifies as a central line. The device must terminate in one of these vessels or in or near the heart to qualify as a central line.
&#8226;An introducer is considered an intravascular catheter.
&#8226;Pacemaker wires and other nonlumened devices inserted into central blood vessels or the heart are not considered central lines, because fluids are not infused, pushed, nor withdrawn through such devices.

Infusion: The introduction of a solution through a blood vessel via a catheter lumen. This may include continuous infusions such as nutritional fluids or medications, or it may include intermittent infusions such as flushes or IV antimicrobial administration, or blood, in the case of transfusion or hemodialysis.

Umbilical catheter: A central vascular device inserted through the umbilical artery or vein in a neonate.

Temporary central line: A non-tunneled catheter.

Permanent central line: Includes
&#8226;Tunneled catheters, including certain dialysis catheters
&#8226;Implanted catheters (including ports)

CLABSI incidence rates stratified by patient care location and in some instances, location bed size and type of medical school affiliation. Example: expected number of CLABSI (and CLABSI rates) in an adult ICU are not the same as in an NICU.
            
CLABSI rates per 1000 central line device days are used to calculate the expected number of CLABSI for the denominator in SIR. They are indirectly standardized rates accounting for the influence of length of stay and length of central line use, and are stratified by patient care location, adjusting for differences in patient morbidity and disease-specific variables, which may influence CLABSI risk.

All potential sources of bloodstream infection would require a comprehensive compendium of infectious disease definitions for the EHR. The inclusion criteria for primary bloodstream infection are specified for this measure. As primary bloodstream infection is sometimes a diagnosis of exclusion, the user is expected to identify other potential sources for the bacteremia based on the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) criteria located at: [Link].

In addition, differentiation of sources of inflammatory reaction is complex. The used is expected to differentiate infectious vs. non-infectious sources based on CDC criteria: [Link].

The denominator for this measure is the summation of the count of central line days. The start and stop times for this calculation are dependent on when and where the central line was inserted and removed (i.e., prior to arriving at the ICU, during the ICU stay, or after transfer out of the ICU). For reporting purposes, the denominator should report the calculated central line days.

The elements 'Procedure performed: central line accessed' and 'Procedure performed: central line removed' are referencing the same central line, not different lines.

The elements 'Device applied: Umbilical Line,' 'Procedure performed: Umbilical Line Accessed,' and 'Procedure performed: Umbilical Line Removed' are represented with non-specific central line codes, however are specifically referring to umbilical-related concepts.

                     Calculation is generic to all measures:
                     
         <ul>
            <li>Calculate the final denominator by adding all that meet denominator criteria.</li>
            <li>Subtract from the final denominator all that do not meet numerator criteria yet also meet exclusion criteria.  Note some measures
               do not have exclusion criteria.
            </li>
            <li>The performance calculation is based on the "Measure scoring" from header information above:
               					        	
               <ul>
                  <li>For "Proportion" measures, the calculation is the number meeting numerator criteria divided by the final denominator.</li>
                  <li>For "Ratio" and "Continuous Variable" measures, follow the calculation instructions in the Data Aggregation header information
                     above, if present.
                  </li>
               </ul>
                              
            </li>
            <li>For measures with multiple denominators, repeat this process for each denominator and report each result separately.</li>
            <li>For measures with multiple patient populations, repeat this process for each patient population and report each result separately.</li>
            <li>For measures with multiple numerators, calculate each numerator separately within each population using the paired exclusion.</li>
