All four reflect that Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause of CAP, that treatment that covers "atypical" pathogens (e.g., Legionella species, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae) can be associated with improved survival, and that the prevalence of antibiotic resistant S. pneumoniae is increasing. 
	
The CMS convened a conference of guideline authors, including Julie Gerberding, MD (CDC), John Bartlett, MD (IDSA), Ronald Grossman, MD (CIDS/CTS), and Michael Niederman, MD (ATS), to reach consensus on the antibiotic regimens that could be considered consistent with all four organizations' guidelines. These regimens are reflected in this measure, and in the Pneumonia Antibiotic Consensus Recommendation located directly behind the measure information form.

                  <div style="width:660px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:auto"><pre>General guidance:

The measure criteria indicate scenarios in which the patient is admitted to the hospital directly (to ICU or Non-ICU locations) or the patient is admitted to one of these locations from the Emergency Department (ED).  The calculation is to indicate the timing from arrival at the facility to the occurrence of an event. The arrival, therefore can be determined from the Emergency Department, the Non-ICU location, or the ICU location, whichever is the first location of contact between the patient and the facility.
	
Patients for whom there are missing or inaccurate data (e.g., arrival time, medication administration, etc.) are considered to have failed the measure; the total number of patients with missing or erroneous (e.g., a time of 03:69 or a date of 10/26/2035) data (i.e., measure failures) must be reported with the results of the measure.


Exclusion element guidance:

The exclusion for patients who are clinical trial participants is limited to patients participating in a clinical trial for pneumonia, the same condition as covered by the measure. Other clinical trials are not valid reasons for exclusions.

Transfers from another hospital or an Emergency Department that is not part of the hospital's organization are excluded since care may have been delivered in the other setting.  The measure as specified for abstraction allowed determination of other hospital or other hospital Emergency Departments by hospital billing number. Transfers within 1 day from those hospitals or Emergency Departments using the same facility number are not considered transfers for the exclusion section of this measure, those using other facility numbers are considered exclusions.

Any patient with a blood culture result available in the first 24 hours after patient arrival is excluded if:
a) The culture result identifies bacterial pathogens and susceptibilities that would require treatment with antibiotics, and
b) The culture is not considered a contaminant

The exclusion for absolute neutrophil count &lt; 500 may require calculation. The absolute neutrophil count (ANC) = Total WBC x (% "Segs" + % "Bands"), OR WBC x ((Segs/100) + (Bands/100)).

      <div>
         Calculation is generic to all measures:
         
         <ul>
            <li>Calculate the final denominator by adding all that meet denominator criteria.</li>
            <li>Subtract from the final denominator all that do not meet numerator criteria yet also meet exclusion criteria.  Note some measures
               do not have exclusion criteria.
            </li>
            <li>The performance calculation is based on the "Measure scoring" from header information above:
               					        	
               <ul>
                  <li>For "Proportion" measures, the calculation is the number meeting numerator criteria divided by the final denominator.</li>
                  <li>For "Ratio" and "Continuous Variable" measures, follow the calculation instructions in the Data Aggregation header information
                     above, if present.
                  </li>
               </ul>
               
            </li>
            <li>For measures with multiple denominators, repeat this process for each denominator and report each result separately.</li>
            <li>For measures with multiple patient populations, repeat this process for each patient population and report each result separately.</li>
            <li>For measures with multiple numerators, calculate each numerator separately within each population using the paired exclusion.</li>
         </ul>
