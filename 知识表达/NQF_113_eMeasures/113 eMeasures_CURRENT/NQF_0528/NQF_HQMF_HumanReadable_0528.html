                  <div style="width:660px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:auto"><pre>The measurement period is one calendar year but the reporting period is 3 months as a calendar quarter; Q1 = Jan &#8211; Mar, Q2 = Apr &#8211; Jun, Q3 = Jul &#8211; Sep, Q4 is Oct &#8211; Dec.

Patients for whom there are missing or inaccurate data (e.g., arrival time, medication administration, etc.) are considered to have failed the measure; the total number of patients with missing or erroneous (e.g., a time of 03:69 or a date of 10/26/2035) data (i.e., measure failures) must be reported with the results of the measure.

General guidance:

The original measure excludes patients who have had a laparoscopic procedure unless the laparoscopic incision has been extended during the procedure.  ICD-10 allows definition of such extension with procedure codes; ICD-9 does not. For those using ICD-9 any laparoscopic procedure that extends the incision should be included.
In this measure the code lists that describe types of surgical procedures remain only in ICD-9 or ICD-10 because the concepts that apply are limited to a very specific subset of all surgical procedures.

Numerator element guidance:

Vancomycin is acceptable for CABG, other cardiac procedures, hip arthroplasty, knee arthroplasty and vascular surgery if there is an increased MRSA rate facility-wide or operation-specific. For the purpose of using vancomycin for prophylaxis, it is expected that vancomycin is given ONLY if one of the allowable conditions is TRUE. Note also, that all numerators numbered using "x.1" (e.g., 1.1, 2.1, etc.) are to be used for calculating successful performance for the measure.  Numerators numbered using "x.2" (e.g ., 1.2, 2.2, 3.2, etc.) are to be used for reporting only and indicate the number excluded due to lack of documentation to justify vancomycin use. All instances that are described in Numerators "x.2" are non-compliant with Numerators "x.1" in calculating the measure performance.

      <div>
         Calculation is generic to all measures:
         
         <ul>
            <li>Calculate the final denominator by adding all that meet denominator criteria.</li>
            <li>Subtract from the final denominator all that do not meet numerator criteria yet also meet exclusion criteria.  Note some measures
               do not have exclusion criteria.
            </li>
            <li>The performance calculation is based on the "Measure scoring" from header information above:
               					        	
               <ul>
                  <li>For "Proportion" measures, the calculation is the number meeting numerator criteria divided by the final denominator.</li>
                  <li>For "Ratio" and "Continuous Variable" measures, follow the calculation instructions in the Data Aggregation header information
                     above, if present.
                  </li>
               </ul>
               
            </li>
            <li>For measures with multiple denominators, repeat this process for each denominator and report each result separately.</li>
            <li>For measures with multiple patient populations, repeat this process for each patient population and report each result separately.</li>
            <li>For measures with multiple numerators, calculate each numerator separately within each population using the paired exclusion.</li>
